# Bill of Materials (BOM)

The file `BOM.csv` in this folder lists all components needed for the AI-powered electronic nose. Each row contains:

- **Reference**: The reference designator on the PCB (e.g., R1, C3, U2).
- **Component**: A short description (e.g., “STM32F103C8T6”, “MQ-2 sensor”, “IRLZ44N MOSFET”).
- **Quantity**: How many of that component the board requires.
- **Value/Model**: Exact part number or value (e.g., “STM32F103C8T6”, “MQ-2 breakout”).
- **Footprint**: SMD/through-hole footprint name (e.g., “SOIC-20”, “TO-92”).
- **Supplier Link**: URL or distributor part number (optional).
- **Unit Cost (USD)**: Approximate unit price.
- **Total Cost (USD)**: Quantity × Unit Cost.
- **Notes**: Any special notes (e.g., “Buy from Mouser”, “Tolerances: 1%”).

When ordering, double-check the footprint, package, and any matching requirements.
